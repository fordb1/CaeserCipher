# CaeserCipher
I'm creating a program that allows you to enter a statement that becomes encrypted from a Caeser Cipher.

A Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption method in which each letter is shifted by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. For instance, if the shift was the number 5, "A" would become "F".
In Cybersecuirty, the Caesar Cipher helps to illustrate the basic principle of encyrption. It turns tables and statements from readable to unreadable. While simple and easy to break, it helped to introduce foundtional concepts of confidentiality, secure communication, and cryptographic keys, which play vital roles in modern day cybersecurity.
